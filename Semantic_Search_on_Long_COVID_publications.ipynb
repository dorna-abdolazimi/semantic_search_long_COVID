There are a variey of [pretrained sentence transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) for IR/semantic search on SentenceTransformers 🤗. These models were trained on datasets such as [PAQ](https://github.com/facebookresearch/PAQ), [MSMARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/), [GoogleAQ](https://github.com/allenai/gooaq) and, while their general performance is good, they can perform rather poorly on domains that are very different from the domain that they were trained on. The main challenge in domain adaptation for IR is the lack of labeled training data for the specific domian of interest. Adaptive pre-training methods such as [TSDAE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06979) and [generative pseudo-labeling (GPL)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07577) are the main two techniques that have been proposed for this scenario. In this project, we use GPL to finetune [msmarco-distilbert-dot-v5](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-dot-v5) for IR in our domain.\n","\n","### Motivation for information retrieval on publications related to long COVID\n"," Long COVID, also known as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is defined by WHO as the continuation or development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation. PASC is a multi-organ disease for which over 200 different symptoms have been reported. While it is estimated that [about 7% of the population ](https://ceal.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/CEAL-WhatYouNeedtoKnowLongCOVID-English.pdf) suffers from PASC, this complex disease and possible treatments are not well-understood. As research on this prevalent and multi-organ condition is rapidly evolving, it is important for general practitioners, patients, and other indivisuals concerned or interested in this disease to be able to answer relevant questions based on the evolving research using an information retrieval system that performs well on related publications.\n","\n"," ### Motivation for the use of GPL\n"," Adaptive pre-training methods first pre-train on the unlabeled target corpus using methods such MLM or TSDAE and then finetune on an existing labeled dateset. A major disadvantage of these methods is that these methods are very expensive computationally. To get a desirable results, one has to use a very varge labeled training dataset (of the order of tens of millions of training pairs/triplets). On the other hand, GPL could be used to finetune a pretrained sentence transformer/bi-encoder model using a generated training set of much smaller size (e.g. less than half a million triplets). While the performance of GPL is often not as high as TSDAE, it often achieves significant improvement over the zero-shot model (for some comparisons of different methods see Table 1 in the [GPL paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07577). Given limited compuation resources for this personal project, I chose GPL over adaptive pre-training methods.\n","\n"," ### Result\n"," I compared the performance of the finetuned model with the original [msmarco-distilbert-dot-v5](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/) model on a set of 30 questions that include both general questions such as the prevalence and the risk factors and advanced scientific questions such as the pathophysiology of PASC. While the origial model had a high performance on general queries, its performance was poor on advanced topics. Using the finetuned model, the mAP@10 (Mean Average Precision) increased from 0.646 to 0.704 (8% relative increase), mainly due to significantly better performance on queries related to more advanced scientific topics."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Required Packages"],"metadata":{"id":"bfpb5eFYU-Fx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install datasets sentence_transformers faiss-gpu biopython Bio openai --quiet"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gycbG-vEUoUR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721683642309,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":97108,"user":{"displayName":"Dorna Abdolazimi","userId":"05845364217500741266"}},"outputId":"753db4ed-677c-4c99-c20f-285949609aa6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m547.8/547.8 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m227.1/227.1 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m85.5/85.5 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m3.2/3.2 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m38.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m281.0/281.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m18.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m39.9/39.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m10.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m116.3/116.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m9.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m64.9/64.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m194.1/194.1 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m134.8/134.8 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m21.3/21.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m69.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

While some studies have suggested that older adults may not be at a higher risk of long COVID than younger individuals , this may be because there are more younger COVID-19 survivors, and the epidemiological statistics for long COVID in elderly people exclude a substantial number of fatalities and may introduce bias towards older adults . Additionally, many mechanisms of long COVID remain unclear, and there is a lack of targeted and effective treatment options . Considering that older adults are a population that requires considerable health care resources, long COVID in this population remains a major challenge in public health, clinical medicine, and basic medical research.\n","passage 1: Prevalence and characteristics of long COVID in elderly patients: An observational cohort study of over 2 million adults in the US: Based on a constellation of symptoms identified in the WHO’s consensus definition, we estimate that long COVID occurs in 16.6% and 29.2% of elderly COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients, respectively. The corresponding incidence for long Flu, identified by the same constellation of symptoms for 2 pre-pandemic influenza seasons, is about the same (17% and 24.6%). Long COVID patients have significantly higher incidence of dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, loss of taste or smell, and neurocognitive symptoms. Compared to long Flu, patients with long COVID are hospitalized more often and have more outpatient visits, suggesting that it is a more serious illness and has higher societal impact.\n","passage 2: Prevalence and Factors Associated with Long COVID Symptoms among U.S. Adults, 2022: This study found long COVID was most common among younger age groups, females, NH American Indian or Alaska Native and NH other or multiracial groups, those with lower annual household income, those with no health insurance, and those living in the Midwest or South, which was consistent with other studies . Long COVID was also more common among adults who had overweight or obesity, were current or former smokers, had a disability, or had depression. These represented vulnerable groups that were at greater risk for long COVID and at the same time, less likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19, which could protect them from severe health consequences .\n","passage 3: Long COVID symptoms in a population-based sample of persons discharged home from hospital: What does this study add to existing knowledge?\n","The prevalence of long COVID in a population-based sample of people who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and discharged home (and not to a nursing home or other facility) is 31.5%.Time since COVID-19 infection was not associated with the likelihood of long COVID; in fact, nearly three quarters of our sample were diagnosed more than 6 months prior to the interview, indicating that these symptoms do not resolve quickly.Factors associated with persistent symptoms were: having a greater number of symptoms, an increased length of stay in hospital, female sex, and higher educational level.\n","passage 4: Self-Reported Long COVID in the General Population: Sociodemographic and Health Correlates in a Cross-National Sample: 4.2. Prevalence of Long COVID: This study showed that 29% of participants who had experienced COVID-19 also reported longstanding or chronic COVID-19 symptoms. As all information in this study is based on self-reports, there is substantial uncertainty associated with this prevalence measure. Self-report measures tend to yield a higher frequency of cases compared to the frequencies obtained by clinical diagnosis . However, at face value, the prevalence found in this study is similar to that reported by Tenforde and colleagues , but lower than the prevalence rates (about 50%) reported in other studies . In general, prevalence rates of long COVID are difficult to interpret in the absence of commonly and rigidly applied diagnostic criteria and in the context of widely varying research methodologies.\n","query: what is known about the effect of reinfection on the risk of PASC?\n","passage 0: Treatment of COVID-19 during the Acute Phase in Hospitalized Patients Decreases Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19: Our study investigates the impact of treatment during the acute phase on the risk of PASC and presents several strengths and limitations. One of the major strengths is that it is one of the few reports to highlight the potential benefit of treatment in the acute phase in reducing the risk of PASC. What is new is that the treatment decreases the incidence of PASC, including in patients without risk factors for severe COVID-19, for whom treatment is not currently recommended. This emphasizes the importance of treating patients who may not develop severe COVID-19 but are at risk for PASC. Additionally, our study benefits from a large and diverse population sample, encompassing individuals with varying severity levels of COVID-19, and a comprehensive and lengthy follow-up period that includes both clinical and laboratory parameters. Moreover, the standardized treatment protocols implemented since April 2020 have facilitated a more homogeneous comparison, with reliable data collected from electronic health records.\n","passage 1: SARS-CoV-2 Reinfections and Long COVID in the Post-Omicron Phase of the Pandemic: 5.1. Do Repeated Infections with SARS-CoV-2 Increase the Likelihood of Long COVID?: The potential impact of reinfections on increasing the likelihood of long COVID, or on exacerbating pre-existing long COVID, are key questions as the pandemic potentially moves into an endemic phase. Long COVID patients with low levels of protective antibodies and increased levels of autoantibodies are possibly more prone to SARS-CoV-2 reinfections . The cumulative risk of long COVID was found to increase in proportion to the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, when compared with no reinfection, primarily in older age . Furthermore, compared with those infected once, patients who were reinfected were more prone not only to long COVID, but also to various complications, including potential cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological problems.\n","passage 2: The burden of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms in a multinational network cohort analysis: Research in context: The effect of reinfection on the severity and persistence of COVID-19 symptoms remains a topic of great interest. Our multinational study assessed the effect of reinfection on the risk of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms as defined by the WHO. Our results showed an increased risk for post-acute COVID-19 symptoms following re-infection, suggesting that people with re-infections remain at risk for developing persisting symptoms. Previous studies on this topic are scarce and discordant: A previous study on post-acute complications and organ system disorders in people following first or reinfection in the US Veterans Health Administration database reported a twofold increased risk for at least one sequela, which was consistent regardless of vaccination status. However, this previous study did not investigate long COVID as an outcome, and the study population was not representative of the general population. Another study by the Office of National Statistics based on data from the COVID-19 Infection Survey, however, reported a 28% lower risk for new-onset, self-reported post-acute COVID-19 symptoms among adults after a second COVID-19 infection compared with a first infection.\n","passage 3: An intersectional analysis of long COVID prevalence: Embodiment at work: Risks related to occupational exposure and gender roles may account for some disparity in prevalence through reinfection. Although scientific evidence about the relationship between reinfection and the risk of developing long COVID is mixed, reinfection generates greater risk for long COVID than successfully avoiding reinfection . In principle, having a white-collar job that one can do from home should help to avoid reinfection, but remote work may not be a protective factor for women if they are at risk of household exposure through their care responsibilities. A 2023 study found that 70% of within-household transmission of COVID originated with schoolchildren, meaning that women who care for ill children and other family members are at high risk of exposure at home .\n","passage 4: \n","Risk factors for post-acute sequelae of\n","COVID-19 in hospitalized patients: An\n","observational study based on a survey in a\n","tertiary care center in Türkiye\n",": Risk Factors for PASC Development: \n","According to a study from the literature, the factors\n","predicting the risk of developing PASC at the time of\n","COVID-19 diagnosis include type 2 diabetes,\n","circulating SARS-CoV-2 viremia, EBV reactivation,\n","and specific autoantibodies such as type 1 interferon\n","(\n","\n",").\n","Except for women, increasing age, having\n","asthma, and being overweight or obese were also\n","associated with an increased risk of long COVID\n","(\n","\n",").\n","In our study, when the comorbidities of the 256\n","patients were evaluated, it was found that nearly half\n","had at least one comorbidity. 16.28% of all patients\n","had chronic pulmonary disease, and in the\n","multivariate analysis, we found no statistically\n","significant relationship between any long COVID-related symptom and age or gender.\n","\n","query: does covid-19 increase the risk of new-onset diabetes?\n","passage 0: The bidirectional association between diabetes and long-COVID-19 – A systematic review: COVID-19 and new-onset diabetes: Of the studies examining new-onset diabetes in adults, all demonstrated an increased risk for new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 with some sub-group exceptions. For example, a Veteran’s Affair’s study by Wander et al.  reported an increased risk for new-onset diabetes associated with COVID-19 in men (OR: 1.95 (1.80–2.12), but not women (1.04 (0.82–2.12); Al-Aly reported an increased risk for new-onset type 2 diabetes in non-hospitalized but not hospitalized veterans, and for new-onset type 2 but not new-onset type 1 diabetes ; Hernandez-Romieu et al.  reported a 87 % and 125 % increased risk of new-onset diabetes in hospitalized and mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (vs no COVID-19), but a decreased risk for new-onset diabetes in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (prevalence ratio: 0.90 (0.85–0.96)).\n","passage 1: The bidirectional association between diabetes and long-COVID-19 – A systematic review: Further, emerging evidence indicates a potential bi-directional relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 such that diabetes may be both a risk factor for COVID-19-related complications and a complication of COVID-19. For example, several studies have suggested that the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes  increased in 2020–2021 as compared with pre-COVID years, and a 2021 meta-analysis reported a high proportion of new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 . However, these studies do not compare the incidence of new-onset diabetes in people with vs without COVID-19 and thus cannot disentangle the causal impact of COVID-19 infection as compared with more broad pandemic factors (i.e., reduced physical activity, weight gain, job loss) on the risk of developing diabetes. One recent study from the US Department of Veterans Affairs reported that in the post-acute phase, people with COVID-19 were 40 % more likely to develop new diabetes compared to matched people without COVID-19 .\n","passage 2: Susceptibility to Metabolic Diseases in COVID-19: To be or Not to be an Issue: The Effect of COVID-19 on the Pancreas: Diabetes has been introduced as a risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Evidence has revealed that COVID-19 may affect the pathophysiology of diabetes through increased ACE-2 expression, increased paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (FURIN), impaired T-cell function, and increased interleukin-6 (Singh et al., 2020). Therefore, patients with diabetes need special clinical management to avoid the progressive damage. On the other hand, due to the diabetogenic nature of COVID-19, evaluation of recovered patients is essential. In this regard, investigation of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the onset of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 can be beneficial for the prevention and management of the issue.\n","passage 3: Prevalence and risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus after COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis: The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes can be therefore considered as bidirectional. On one hand, diabetic patients are at increased risk to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those with inadequate glycaemic control and chronic vascular complications have particularly high risk to develop the most severe form of the disease . On the other hand, there is also an increased risk of acute complications related to diabetes, considering both the pre-existing and new-onset manifestations , in patients with COVID-19 infection. Among the different mechanisms underlying this relationship, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors could have a possible role due to their widespread localisation in key metabolic organs and tissues including pancreatic beta cells . It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 virus enter in human cells after binding with ACE-2 receptors .\n","passage 4: The bidirectional association between diabetes and long-COVID-19 – A systematic review: COVID-19 and new-onset diabetes: Among two studies, risk estimates also varied depending on the comparison population. For example, Daugherty et al.  examined the risk of new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 compared to people without COVID-19 in 2020, without COVID-19 in 2019 (arguably a true non-COVID population) and in people with AURI. Risk estimates were 83 %, 80 % and 39 %, respectively . In Xie et al. a veterans-based study, risk of new-onset diabetes was 40 % (95 %CI: 36–44) in people with COVID-19 vs a 2020 contemporary cohort of people without COVID-19. This risk decreased slightly to 35 % (31 %–39 %) when the comparison was a historical cohort of people without COVID-19 from 2018 to 2020.\n","query: what is the pathophysiology behind PASC?\n","passage 0: Long COVID: a narrative review of the clinical aftermaths of COVID-19 with a focus on the putative pathophysiology and aspects of physical activity: Nonetheless, the research is still in its infancy and to this day there is a paucity of knowledge regarding virtually all aspects of long COVID. Many different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying long COVID have been described and several principles for the treatment have been proposed. Additionally, there exists an uncertainty regarding how many people experience residual symptoms and if they might be part of distinct syndromes. Therefore, it is the objective of this review to map the existing literature on the classifications, clinical manifestations, potential pathophysiological mechanisms and to provide an evidence-based contextualization of the proposed strategies for the management of the PASC in the context of physical activity.\n","passage 1: Pathophysiology and mechanism of long COVID: a comprehensive review: Up till now, research on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying long COVID has mainly focussed on the acute COVID-19 phase and its subsequent organ dysfunctions. A lot of the research has been focussed on hypothesis generation. Empirical studies are highly heterogeneous in nature, thus rendering their assessment complicated. Grasping the pathophysiology of long COVID remains puzzling, since the clinical spectrum is highly variable and affects many organs . In addition, since symptoms abate over time, the pathophysiological exploration must be performed at different time-points in order to better identify the timeline of mechanisms and natural history of long COVID. Moreover, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases or cancers is still unsure and requires more research. Only a robust understanding of the pathophysiology of long COVID will enable us to appraise and manage these disease consequences .\n","passage 2: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): a meta-narrative review of pathophysiology, prevalence, and management: Pathophysiological Mechanisms: There is little known about the pathophysiology of post-acute COVID-19, but it is thought to be multifactorial as multiple organs are involved . Mechanisms which potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of post-acute COVID-19 include viral-specific pathophysiologic changes, immunologic aberrations, and inflammation in response to the acute infection, and sequelae of post-intensive care syndrome . SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with comorbidities may result in excessive cytokine release, cytokine storm, resulting in a destructive immune response, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), activation of coagulation pathways causing an imbalance of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors resulting in micro-thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death . Immune destruction can also result in autoimmune phenomena and molecular mimicry which lead to autoimmunity .\n","passage 3: Unraveling the Mystery Surrounding Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19: With regards to the pathophysiology of PASC, there are key gaps in knowledge. Direct tissue damage caused by the virus and dysregulated immune response are the two predominant pathophysiological mechanisms that drive the diverse clinical manifestations. However, the extent of damage caused by each is yet to be clearly understood. Future studies need to investigate the site, magnitude and duration of viral infection in association with the type and timing of multi-organ sequelae. Viral mutations are another topic of significance at present and the prevalence of PASC across the various SARS-CoV-2 mutants need to be explored. The potential role of coagulopathy and vasculitis in the pathophysiology of PASC was also identified as an area that needs to be explored . At the same time, the impact of re-infection on the development of PASC warrants investigation.\n","passage 4: Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2: Musculoskeletal Conditions and Pain: The pathophysiology of PASC is thought to involve a prolonged immune system response to initial COVID-19 infection leading to a cascade of inflammatory and/or autoimmune processes. Studies have demonstrated that laboratory abnormalities suggestive of immunologic dysfunction can be present in patients with PASC several months after acute COVID infection. Although the etiology is likely multifactorial and uncertainty remains as to the exact mechanism of PASC-related pain, immune-mediated processes may play a key role in the modulation of the inflammatory response that characterizes pain associated with COVID. Examples of potential mechanisms that may contribute to PASC-related pain and musculoskeletal injuries include dysregulation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the resulting impact on macrophage activation, inflammation and neural signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, fibrin-amyloid microclots, and secondary effects of prolonged illness, including deconditioning and muscle weakness.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here is a summary of the finetuned model's performance on these query:\n","\n","For the first query, passages 0, 1, and 4 present relevant information to the question.\n","\n","For the second query, passages 1 and 3 are very relevant.

How prevalent is long COVID?\n","passage 0: Risk Factors for Long COVID in Older Adults: According to current research , the prevalence of long COVID is estimated to be between 31% and 69%, indicating that over 200 million individuals worldwide may experience long COVID symptoms. While some studies have suggested that older adults may not be at a higher risk of long COVID than younger individuals , this may be because there are more younger COVID-19 survivors, and the epidemiological statistics for long COVID in elderly people exclude a substantial number of fatalities and may introduce bias towards older adults . Additionally, many mechanisms of long COVID remain unclear, and there is a lack of targeted and effective treatment options . Considering that older adults are a population that requires considerable health care resources, long COVID in this population remains a major challenge in public health, clinical medicine, and basic medical research.\n","passage 1: Prevalence and Factors Associated with Long COVID Symptoms among U.S. Adults, 2022: This study found long COVID was most common among younger age groups, females, NH American Indian or Alaska Native and NH other or multiracial groups, those with lower annual household income, those with no health insurance, and those living in the Midwest or South, which was consistent with other studies . Long COVID was also more common among adults who had overweight or obesity, were current or former smokers, had a disability, or had depression. These represented vulnerable groups that were at greater risk for long COVID and at the same time, less likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19, which could protect them from severe health consequences .\n","passage 2: Prevalence and characteristics of long COVID in elderly patients: An observational cohort study of over 2 million adults in the US: Based on a constellation of symptoms identified in the WHO’s consensus definition, we estimate that long COVID occurs in 16.6% and 29.2% of elderly COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients, respectively. The corresponding incidence for long Flu, identified by the same constellation of symptoms for 2 pre-pandemic influenza seasons, is about the same (17% and 24.6%). Long COVID patients have significantly higher incidence of dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, loss of taste or smell, and neurocognitive symptoms. Compared to long Flu, patients with long COVID are hospitalized more often and have more outpatient visits, suggesting that it is a more serious illness and has higher societal impact.\n","passage 3: Mental Fatigue, Activities of Daily Living, Sick Leave and Functional Status among Patients with Long COVID: A Cross-Sectional Study: In a follow-up study of hospitalised patients, the prevalence of long COVID has been reported to reach 76% (1265 of 1655) at six months of follow-up , dropping to 55% (650 of 1190) after two years . The reported prevalence of long COVID for non-hospitalised patients varies and has typically been studied in selected populations . The WHO estimates that 10% of people with COVID-19 will experience long COVID and argues that the condition is independent of the severity of the initial infection . Even so, with the emergence of new virus variants, such as Omicron, the current prevalence of long COVID might differ from earlier estimates. In a recent observational case-control study completed in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of long COVID decreased to 4.5% among Omicron cases from 10.8% among Delta cases, but following the high number of people infected with Omicron, the incidence of long COVID is expected to rise .\n","passage 4: Prevalence and Factors Associated with Long COVID Symptoms among U.S. Adults, 2022: Not surprisingly, long COVID was less common among adults that had been vaccinated compared to adults that were not vaccinated. This finding supports existing evidence about the importance of vaccination in preventing long-term COVID-19 outcomes . In addition, long COVID was also less common among vaccinated groups than unvaccinated groups for 20 out of 32 subgroups examined, such as adults who had overweight or obesity and those with depression, suggesting vaccination could help advance health equity and protect those who were most vulnerable to long-term health consequences of COVID-19. These results not only support previous literature , but also provide novel findings regarding the role of vaccination and long COVID among different subpopulations.\n","query: what is known about the effect of reinfection on the risk of PASC?\n","passage 0: A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, Part 2: host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Indeed, while many individuals recover from SARS-CoV-2, a significant number of patients continue to suffer with long-term disease symptoms (e.g., PASC) long term after recovery from the primary infection . The severity of the primary infection appears to be independent from the possibility and severity of long-term symptoms, though this requires further research. Indeed, it is critical to understand the systemic effects of PASC, its biological mechanism and symptoms, and to develop treatments that promote functional recovery in symptomatic individuals, given the negative health-effects of PASC, as well as the socioeconomic and healthcare burden this condition will impose. Further research on PASC will improve our knowledge and understanding of the condition, as well as enable identification of relevant treatments and interventions to improve patient outcomes.\n","passage 1: Implications of Innate Immunity in Post-Acute Sequelae of Non-Persistent Viral Infections: Prevention of PAS could be considered in treatment of acute viral infections in the future. Notably, some vaccines were previously reported to reduce PAS of viral infections, underlining the importance of vaccines not only in preventing the acute disease but also long-term damage . For PASC, this is currently being debated. Monitoring of inflammation levels after the acute phase could be used as an indicator of potentially developing PAS. A therapeutic approach would thus be to dampen (aberrant) immune reactions, but studies from persistent viruses also remind us that parts of the innate immune system like autophagy may also be required to limit further damage. Thus, re-balancing innate immune activity and decreasing the overall inflammatory burden but allowing effective anti-viral response may very well be one of the key issues in preventing and treating PAS.\n","passage 2: Pathogenic mechanisms of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC): What are PASC factors? When can the factors be assayed in the course of disease progression? Are these factors interrelated or independent? What are the immune and genomic signatures of PASC? What is the eventual public disease burden of PASC? What does PASC mean for patients and what can be done about it? The unknowns about PASC are too numerous to list. We still do not know if there is a correlation between PASC and the duration/frequency/severity of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the subsequent iterations of the virus (i.e., omicron variants) with factors like age, gender, demographics, and comorbidities are not clear. The longitudinal collection of biospecimens and deep phenotyping of PASC subjects in the RECOVER study will provide a rich set of resources to answer key prognostic, epidemiologic and pathophysiologic questions about PASC and will serve as a platform for testing interventions to prevent or treat PASC.\n","passage 3: Implications of Innate Immunity in Post-Acute Sequelae of Non-Persistent Viral Infections: Due to the rising public and scientific interest in PAS of viruses in the aftermath of the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical and molecular studies have been launched, including research on how vaccines may impact post-acute symptoms . However, drawing parallels with previous insights on PAS of other non-persistent viruses may help us understand how PASC develops and can be treated or prevented. Vice versa, future studies will undoubtedly generally improve our understanding of the common molecular mechanisms of post-acute sequelae of non-persistent viral infections, may provide new models for molecular studies and eventually clarify the contribution of aberrant innate immune activity.\n","passage 4: Treatment of COVID-19 during the Acute Phase in Hospitalized Patients Decreases Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19: Our study investigates the impact of treatment during the acute phase on the risk of PASC and presents several strengths and limitations. One of the major strengths is that it is one of the few reports to highlight the potential benefit of treatment in the acute phase in reducing the risk of PASC. What is new is that the treatment decreases the incidence of PASC, including in patients without risk factors for severe COVID-19, for whom treatment is not currently recommended. This emphasizes the importance of treating patients who may not develop severe COVID-19 but are at risk for PASC. Additionally, our study benefits from a large and diverse population sample, encompassing individuals with varying severity levels of COVID-19, and a comprehensive and lengthy follow-up period that includes both clinical and laboratory parameters. Moreover, the standardized treatment protocols implemented since April 2020 have facilitated a more homogeneous comparison, with reliable data collected from electronic health records.\n","query: does covid-19 increase the risk of new-onset diabetes?\n","passage 0: The bidirectional association between diabetes and long-COVID-19 – A systematic review: COVID-19 and new-onset diabetes: Of the studies examining new-onset diabetes in adults, all demonstrated an increased risk for new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 with some sub-group exceptions. For example, a Veteran’s Affair’s study by Wander et al.  reported an increased risk for new-onset diabetes associated with COVID-19 in men (OR: 1.95 (1.80–2.12), but not women (1.04 (0.82–2.12); Al-Aly reported an increased risk for new-onset type 2 diabetes in non-hospitalized but not hospitalized veterans, and for new-onset type 2 but not new-onset type 1 diabetes ; Hernandez-Romieu et al.  reported a 87 % and 125 % increased risk of new-onset diabetes in hospitalized and mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (vs no COVID-19), but a decreased risk for new-onset diabetes in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (prevalence ratio: 0.90 (0.85–0.96)).\n","passage 1: COVID-19 and the hidden threat of diabetic microvascular\n","complications: COVID-19 has superimposed on the pre-existing diabetes pandemic with a potential for\n","a significant impact on the individual, society and economy. Diabetes worsens\n","outcomes in patients with COVID-19, particularly those with microvascular and\n","macrovascular complications, because of common pathologies between diabetes and\n","COVID-19. A growing body of data suggests that there is a relationship between the\n","presence of diabetic microvascular complications and adverse outcomes in those with\n","acute COVID-19. Patients with diabetes, especially those with microvascular\n","complications, may also be at increased risk of PCS. More research is warranted on\n","the bidirectional relationship between diabetes and its complications, and both\n","acute and post-acute disease in COVID-19.\n","passage 2: The bidirectional association between diabetes and long-COVID-19 – A systematic review: Further, emerging evidence indicates a potential bi-directional relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 such that diabetes may be both a risk factor for COVID-19-related complications and a complication of COVID-19. For example, several studies have suggested that the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes  increased in 2020–2021 as compared with pre-COVID years, and a 2021 meta-analysis reported a high proportion of new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 . However, these studies do not compare the incidence of new-onset diabetes in people with vs without COVID-19 and thus cannot disentangle the causal impact of COVID-19 infection as compared with more broad pandemic factors (i.e., reduced physical activity, weight gain, job loss) on the risk of developing diabetes. One recent study from the US Department of Veterans Affairs reported that in the post-acute phase, people with COVID-19 were 40 % more likely to develop new diabetes compared to matched people without COVID-19 .\n","passage 3: Cardiovascular and Renal Risk Factors and Complications Associated With COVID-19: In addition to hypertension and obesity, diabetes is strongly associated with COVID-19. Large population studies reported that people with type 2 diabetes are more than twice as likely to have died from COVID-19 than those without diabetes in the background population (after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation, and geographical region). The risk is even higher in people with type 1 diabetes. Patients with diabetes who developed COVID-19 that was either fatal or required care in the intensive-care unit have more comorbidities and complications (eg, retinopathy) but also poorer glycemic control and higher rates of previous ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia hospitalization.\n","passage 4: The bidirectional association between diabetes and long-COVID-19 – A systematic review: COVID-19 and new-onset diabetes: Among two studies, risk estimates also varied depending on the comparison population. For example, Daugherty et al.  examined the risk of new-onset diabetes in people with COVID-19 compared to people without COVID-19 in 2020, without COVID-19 in 2019 (arguably a true non-COVID population) and in people with AURI. Risk estimates were 83 %, 80 % and 39 %, respectively . In Xie et al. a veterans-based study, risk of new-onset diabetes was 40 % (95 %CI: 36–44) in people with COVID-19 vs a 2020 contemporary cohort of people without COVID-19. This risk decreased slightly to 35 % (31 %–39 %) when the comparison was a historical cohort of people without COVID-19 from 2018 to 2020.\n","query: what is the pathophysiology behind PASC?\n","passage 0: Pathogenic mechanisms of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC): What are PASC factors? When can the factors be assayed in the course of disease progression? Are these factors interrelated or independent? What are the immune and genomic signatures of PASC? What is the eventual public disease burden of PASC? What does PASC mean for patients and what can be done about it? The unknowns about PASC are too numerous to list. We still do not know if there is a correlation between PASC and the duration/frequency/severity of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the subsequent iterations of the virus (i.e., omicron variants) with factors like age, gender, demographics, and comorbidities are not clear. The longitudinal collection of biospecimens and deep phenotyping of PASC subjects in the RECOVER study will provide a rich set of resources to answer key prognostic, epidemiologic and pathophysiologic questions about PASC and will serve as a platform for testing interventions to prevent or treat PASC.\n","passage 1: Considerations in Children and Adolescents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of PASC is constantly evolving. Although much has been published describing reputed causes, few studies include broadly generalizable clinical data. In addition, it is unknown if the pathophysiology behind PASC in children differs from adults. The heterogeneity of the clinical spectrum suggests that multiple mechanisms may be at play; literature demonstrating phenotypic symptomatic clustering of patients with PASC further suggests a multifactorial process. Persistent symptoms may be due to virus-driven tissue damage from acute infection in certain cases, such as acute lung damage following respiratory infection or anosmia/parosmia following direct upper respiratory infection. However, alternative explanations are needed to understand persistent or late-onset symptoms in individuals lacking evidence of direct viral tissue invasion. The proposed mechanisms for the latter include immune dysregulation and inflammation in response to a restricted or persistent viral reservoir potentially leading to autoimmunity/molecular mimicry, micro-clots and endothelial damage, metabolic and gastrointestinal microbiome alterations, or autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\n","\n","passage 2: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): a meta-narrative review of pathophysiology, prevalence, and management: Ongoing studies to improve our understanding and ability to treat PASC are underway and seek to elucidate the clinical spectrum and biology of those that have recovered from COVID-19 infection, as well as understand the phenotype of those patients who do not fully recover. Further studies are also needed to understand the long-term implications of COVID-19 and PASC as it is currently uncertain if the SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates or promotes the pathogenesis of conditions or findings previously discussed or increases the risk of development of other disorders. There are many ongoing efforts to further understand PASC, including the National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative launch . Open and collaborative efforts may significantly provide pathways to better report, understand, and explore best practices for managing PASC.\n","passage 3: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC): a meta-narrative review of pathophysiology, prevalence, and management: There is ambiguity in defining differences between post-COVID syndrome (PCS), PACS, and PASC in the published literature . We have given our own refinement for this categorization. PASC is becoming a recognizable and crucial clinical entity as data continue to inform of its pathogenesis, presentation, and clinical course. Anecdotal reporting has also raised questions about the implications of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and the improvement in PASC. One out of five patients report improvement, mainly brain fog and anosmia, after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination . Two-thirds of patients with PASC saw no worsening of symptoms after vaccination; fever, chills, and gastro-intestinal symptoms were frequently reported, similar to the general population . This will require further research.\n","passage 4: Long Covid: where we stand and challenges ahead: \n","PASC is a frequent legacy of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting over 10% of patients with different signs and symptoms across a wide range of organs and systems.The most frequent manifestations of PASC, in addition to compromised lung functions, include: neurocognitive alterations; alterations of cardiovascular functions and increased risk of acute events; fatigue.The SARS-CoV-2 virus seeds and persists in different organs and tissues.The pathogenesis of PASC is multifactorial and includes: virus seeding and persistence in different organs; activation and response to unrelated viruses (e.g., EBV); autoimmunity; uncontrolled inflammation.Biomarkers of clinical PASC include levels of IgG, cytokines, chemokines, PTX3, and interferons.Vaccination reduces PASC after breakthrough infection.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Here is a summary of the original model's performance on these queries.\n","\n","For the first query, passages 0, 2, and 3 provide relevant answers to the question.\n","\n","For the second query, none of the retrieved passages are directly relevant to the question.
